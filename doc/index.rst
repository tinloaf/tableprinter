Welcome to Tableprinter's documentation!
========================================

Tableprinter is a small python module that allows you to print your data in tables, be it as ASCII table, HTML table or
LaTeX tabular. It allows for hierarchical columns and rows (see an example TODO of this). To jump right in, you can have
a look at the :ref:`examples <examples>`, or you can read the :ref:`API docs <api>`.
